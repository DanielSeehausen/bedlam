### to do:
  * refactor the avg combo bits for readability in combo-mode.coffee
  * add power setting toggle in config (either fix it at 1 via setting or leave it dynamic)
  * add fade out on number and bar
  * change power/acc/benchmark to power everywhere (done?)
  * reference original author and submit pull request for the base stuff
  * change ludicrous clip to just 'ludicrous'
  * normalize all audio clips
  * fix issue where keyboard input sounds aren't running for first couple of clicks
  * fix audio config to reflect keyboard feedback vs. voices
    * along with that give option to turn voice off
  * fix rest of config options for explosions etc.
  * get the unused explosion functions that fetch the location of the combo counter working as intended (for laptop resolutions and split panes)
  * balance sounds (SH: 'yes' goes up. KI: 'combo-breaker' goes up slightly)
  * change default tab sound to gun, overriding typewriter
